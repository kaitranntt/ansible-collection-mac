## Quality Components

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before commits:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint
    rev: v25.9.2
    hooks:
      - id: ansible-lint
        files: \.(yaml|yml)$

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: yamllint
        name: yamllint
        entry: yamllint
        language: system
        files: \.(yaml|yml)$
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Install hooks
make setup-hooks

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 2. Linting and Formatting

**YAML Linting** (.yamllint):
- Enforces consistent YAML formatting
- Validates YAML syntax
- Checks for common issues

**Ansible Linting** (ansible-lint):
- Validates Ansible best practices
- Checks for security issues
- Enforces naming conventions

**Python Formatting** (black):
- Consistent Python code formatting
- Automatic code style enforcement

### 3. Security Scanning

**Multi-layered Security Approach**:

1. **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security
2. **Bandit**: Python code security
3. **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. **Secret Detection**: Sensitive data scanning

**Security Report Structure**:
```
security-reports/
├── SECURITY_AUDIT.md      # Comprehensive security report
├── security-summary.txt   # Executive summary
├── checkov-report.json    # Infrastructure security findings
├── bandit-report.json     # Python security findings
├── safety-report.json     # Dependency vulnerability findings
└── secret-files.txt       # Secret detection results
```

### 4. Quality Metrics

**Comprehensive Quality Scoring**:

- **Code Quality**: 25% weight (comments, structure, maintainability)
- **Test Coverage**: 30% weight (test results, coverage)
- **Security Posture**: 25% weight (vulnerabilities, security tools)
- **Documentation**: 20% weight (completeness, quality)

**Quality Reports**:
```
quality-reports/
├── QUALITY_REPORT.md      # Human-readable quality report
├── quality-metrics.json   # Machine-readable metrics
└── historical/            # Trend analysis data
```

## Quality Gates

### Automated Quality Checks

**CI/CD Pipeline Quality Gates**:

1. **Code Formatting**: Must pass Black and yamlfmt
2. **Linting**: Must pass ansible-lint and yamllint
3. **Security**: No critical/high vulnerabilities
4. **Tests**: All tests must pass
5. **Documentation**: Must be up-to-date

### Quality Score Requirements

| Grade | Score Range | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| A+    | 90-100      | Excellent quality, all checks pass |
| A     | 80-89       | High quality, minor issues allowed |
| B     | 70-79       | Good quality, some improvements needed |
| C     | 60-69       | Acceptable, significant improvements needed |
| D     | 50-59       | Needs improvement, major issues |
| F     | <50         | Unacceptable, must fix before merge |

### Blocking Issues

**PR Blocking Issues**:
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Test failures
- Breaking changes without proper version bump
- Missing documentation for new features

## Security Scanning

### Security Tools Configuration

**Checkov Configuration** (.checkov.yaml.bak):
```yaml
skip-check:
  - CKV_ANSIBLE_1  # HTTPS URL checks (warnings only)
```

**Bandit Configuration** (.bandit):
```ini
[bandit]
exclude_dirs = tests,docs
skips = B101,B601  # Skip assert_used, shell_injection_process
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **No Secrets in Code**: Never commit sensitive data
2. **Use Ansible Vault**: For encrypting sensitive variables
3. **Regular Scanning**: Run security scans locally before commits
4. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Vulnerability Response**: Address security issues promptly

### Security Reports

**Daily Security Scan**:
```bash
make security

# Review security reports
cat security-reports/SECURITY_AUDIT.md
```

**Security Metrics**:
- Critical vulnerabilities: 0 (blocking)
- High vulnerabilities: 0 (blocking)
- Medium vulnerabilities: <5 (warning)
- Low vulnerabilities: <10 (info)

## Quality Metrics

### Generating Quality Metrics

```bash
# Generate comprehensive report
make quality-metrics

# Show quality score only
make quality-score

# Generate detailed report
make quality-report

# Analyze trends
make quality-trend
```

### Understanding Quality Scores

   git commit -m "lots of changes"
   ```

2. **Conventional Commits**
   ```bash
   # Use conventional commit format
   git commit -m "feat(tailscale): add support for custom exit nodes"
   git commit -m "fix(security): address CVE-2024-1234"
   git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
   ```

3. **Local Testing Before Commit**
   ```bash
   # Always run quality checks locally
   make quality
